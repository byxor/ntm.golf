${title("NTM Pin Randomizer")}

In the MVS/AES release of Neo Turf Masters, every hole has 8 pin positions.

_**Note:** The Neo Geo CD release has a "Grand Slam" gamemode which includes additional pin positions. These pins are unavailable on the MVS/AES release._


During gameplay, depending on the selected difficulty, one of six pins will be selected.
