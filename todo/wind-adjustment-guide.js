// for crosswind, select the wind, and it'll show the relevant image e.g. flag-1 flag-2 flag-3
// all the images will be on a nice flat course like australia, from the same position
// without too many trees in the way etc
// (will animate nicely if there's a slider)
// (implemented using crosswind table)

// (warning: need to be careful about skybox images so clouds don't jump around)

// also consider adding some sin/cos magic to support tailwind calculations later on.
