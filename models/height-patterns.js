// Note for readers:
//
// This is an attempt to understand why "identical"
// shots (same power, same height, but different height cycle),
// can have different outcomes.
//
// There are unknown variables or factors that affect
// the outcome of shots, which may or may not
// be under our control as players.
//
// -------------------------------------------
//
// From inspecting the 2 "shot height" bytes.
//
// Note: there are 2 more bytes (at shot height - 18 bytes)
// that seem to be related in some manner.
//
// Starting from when power is initially selected.
// Ending when the pattern begins to repeat.
//
// Bytes are in the order they appear in RAM.
//
// Afternote: TBH it looks like these 2 bytes may have separate purposes,
// rather than conveying a single number. Not sure though.

// TODO: also document height meter reading e.g. "N" alongside each entry.

// TODO: also consider documenting the other 2 height bytes that might be related.
